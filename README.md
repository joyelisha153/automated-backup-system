Automated Backup System (Bash Script) A. Project Overview This Bash script automatically creates compressed backups of folders, verifies them, and removes older backups to save space. It is configurable, safe, and easy to use.

B. How to Use It 1️ Setup

Clone or download this project.

Open the folder:

cd backup-system

Make the script executable:

chmod +x backup.sh

2️ Edit Configuration

Open the file backup.config and set:

BACKUP_DESTINATION=/home/user/backups EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=".git,node_modules,.cache" DAILY_KEEP=7 WEEKLY_KEEP=4 MONTHLY_KEEP=3

3️ Run Backup ./backup.sh /path/to/folder

This will create a backup file like:

backup-2025-11-03-1430.tar.gz

and a checksum file:

backup-2025-11-03-1430.tar.gz.md5

4️ Other Commands

Dry run (test mode)

./backup.sh --dry-run /path/to/folder

→ Shows what will happen without doing it.

List all backups

./backup.sh --list

Restore a backup

./backup.sh --restore /home/backups/backup-2025-11-03-1430.tar.gz --to /home/user/restore_folder

Log File

All activities are saved in:

backup.log

Example:

[2025-11-03 14:30:15] INFO: Starting backup of /home/user/documents [2025-11-03 14:30:45] SUCCESS: Backup created successfully [2025-11-03 14:30:46] INFO: Checksum verified

Automatic Cleanup

The script keeps only:

Last 7 daily backups

Last 4 weekly backups

Last 3 monthly backups Older backups are deleted automatically.

Error Handling

The script shows clear error messages if:

Folder doesn’t exist

No permission to read folder

Not enough space

Config file missing

Example Output [2025-11-03 14:30:15] INFO: Starting backup of /home/user/documents [2025-11-03 14:30:45] SUCCESS: Backup created: backup-2025-11-03-1430.tar.gz [2025-11-03 14:30:46] INFO: Checksum verified successfully

That’s It!

Just run the script regularly (or add to cron) to keep your files safe automatically.
